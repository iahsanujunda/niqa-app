      "description": "Although this coffee shop is usually packed with people, it is worth to squeeze in and try their signature Avocado Coffee Float. The strong taste of coffee blends perfectly with the soft texture of avocado juice, topped with sweet and chocolatey taste of chocolate ice-cream. They have various snacks as well, though the Avocado Coffee Float itself is already fulfilling enough. If you prefer the original taste of coffee, they sure have the qualification. The downside is, as the place is usually packed and lots of people usually queueing, you can't really stay for long to chat. But don't worry, you can always jump into another place.",

Once he heard that Medan has a soup restaurant that allows you to <i>drink</i> the merry thing, he wasted no time going there. For those who fancies a bit more spine in their life, we recommend giving Sop Langsa a try. There was a catch to this place though, one group can only order maximum 2 servings of spinal soup as cow spines are quite hard to come by. So if you came with a big group, divide your group into twos and pretend that you don't know each other.",

      "description": "Medanese usually eat this for breakfast. We know you've tried soto, but we swear this one will be different. Expect something like Soto Betawi, but it used coconut milk instead of fresh milk. The taste is richer, we guess it uses more herbs and spices inside. Mira likes it with beef inside, but Junda likes it mixed with the innards. The beef has rich smokey fragrance that blends perfectly with the soup. To add the perfection, it served with tasty green sambal. A helpful tip: mix the sambal with sweet soy sauce, you'll thank us later. The restaurant might seems busy all the time but I can assure you that they're the high-scorer in the Dinner Dash game as they will serve you quickly",

Various types of dim sum are served there and will make you forget about your diet. Do try the leng hong kien (shrimp dim sum with mayonaise) and don't forget to add their special spicy sauce before putting it in your mouth. After stuffing lots of dim sum into your now happy belly, cherish your mouth by eating the dessert : durian pancake. Don't expect the pancake to be the round-shape American breakfast pancake. It's more like seedless durian fillings with fresh cream, wrapped with thin layer of pancake. If you don't like durian, try the avocado one, it's equally delish.",

For less than 20k you can have a full plate of Mie Aceh right in front of you. Choose it as you pleased, be it fried, stewed, or just a stir-fried (with a bit of soup, but not as wet as the stewed one). Beef, chicken, or even the whole crab as the topping. We love it wet, as we think it's more flavourful that way. And oh, do order the martabak telor!",

Lontong Medan to Medanese is like bubur ayam and ketoprak to Jakartans, they're everywhere in the morning. What makes it different with other lontong sayur is, it has lots of things inside other than the sayur itself; it has tauco udang, bihun goreng, spicy anchovy, boiled egg, and sometimes with rendang as well. Rich and heavy, for breakfast standard. We usually eat the one that Kak Umi sells in Johor but we thought it would be more convenient if you go to Kak Lin. It is located in the heart of Medan city, just accross Mira's high school. If you do not like having fatty breakfast, she also sells lontong pecal.",

The texture of the noodles is nice, it has lumpia udang as the topping, as the addition to chicken and boiled eggs. The sambal and pickled chili will contributes to its perfection.
